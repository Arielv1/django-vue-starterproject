# Starter Project - Django For Backend, Vue.Js As Frontend

** Note: If you wish to run the project in a virtualenv run the following command in terminal: Scripts\activate

In order to make the interaction between django and vue work locally we'll need 2 terminal sessions:
Session #1: 
  - cd starter/backend 
  - py manage.py makemigrations
  - py manage.py migrate
  - py manage.py runserver
Session #2: 
  - cd starter/frontend
  - npm run serve
  
With both django and vue running locally the connection between django apps & api's with vue is complete.
